# RTS System - "Warhammer 40k Dawn of War: Soulstorm"-like system 
As the title might suggest, this project was heavily inspired by my favourite RTS game Dawn of War Soulstorm. <br>
This project is meant to be a complete solution to basically create a clone of that game in Unreal Engine 5. <br>
Because the original was made in 2004 there are many technical limitations, like a 2gb ram and vram limitation which is not enough if you want to play with bigger mods like the [Unification](https://www.moddb.com/mods/unification-mod-dawn-of-war-soulstorm) mod or the [Ultimate Apocalypse](https://www.moddb.com/mods/ultimate-apocalypse-mod) mod. To be clear, these are **not** my mods!


### The Goal
- Multiplayer
  - Lobby
  - Game Search
  - Map Selection
  - Faction Selection
  - Game Settings
  - Teams
- Factions
  - buildings
  - units
  - upgrades
  - (resources?)
- (Enemy Behaviour)
